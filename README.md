# Spotify Playlist Generator

The Spotify Playlist Generator is an web-application written in react and express.js that allows you to generate a playlist based on your mood, favorite genre, and artist using the Spotify API and the OpenAI API.

## How it Works
- The user is asked to input their mood, favorite genre, and artist.
- The application uses the OpenAI API to generate a playlist based on the user's input.
- The application displays a preview of the upcoming playlist, and the user can choose to regenerate the playlist or accept it.
- The Spotify API is used to search for tracks with the artist name and song name it gets from OpenAI API.
- If the user accepts the playlist, the application creates a new playlist in the user's Spotify account.
