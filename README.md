Spotify Playlist Generator

The Spotify Playlist Generator is an application that allows you to generate a playlist based on your mood, favorite genre, and artist using the Spotify API and the OpenAI API.

How it Works
The user is asked to input their mood, favorite genre, and artist.
The application uses the OpenAI API to generate a playlist based on the user's input.
The Spotify API is used to search for tracks that match the generated playlist.
The application displays a preview of the upcoming playlist, and the user can choose to regenerate the playlist or accept it.
If the user accepts the playlist, the application creates a new playlist in the user's Spotify account.
